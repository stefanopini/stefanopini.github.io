I am a Machine Learning engineer working on self driving cars at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai/).  

Before joining Wayve, I worked as research scientist/engineer in the autonomous driving division 
of [Woven by Toyota](https://woven.toyota/en/) (former Woven Planet, previously Lyft Level 5), 
focusing on perception, prediction and planning.  

Previously, 
I pursued my PhD at [AImageLab](https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/), 
the Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence laboratory of the University of 
Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy).  
I was enrolled in the Computer Engineering and Science track of the ICT Doctorate 
School of the Department of Engineering. The topic of my doctoral project was 
"Computer Vision and Artficial Intelligence for Automotive applications".  

As a PhD candidate, my work mostly focused on computer vision algorithms and systems that could 
improve the human-computer interaction in the automotive context, using reliable 
and light-invariant sensors such as depth (2.5D), infrared, and thermal cameras.

From 2018 to 2021, I was a member of the 
[RedVision Lab](https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/go/redvisionlab), a joint laboratory 
with Ferrari S.p.A. aiming at applying computer vision techniques in the 
automotive field, in particular to improve the human-vehicle interaction, the driver 
monitoring, and the passenger experience.

From April to October 2021, I joined the Level 5 department of Lyft Level 5 / Woven Planet 
for a 6-month internship. I joined the London Research Team 
and worked on deep learning-based simulation for autonomous driving systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to OpenStreetMap and open source projects! 
Some of them are available on my [github profile](https://github.com/stefanopini).
