### Abstract
Few works tackle the Human Pose Estimation on depth maps. Moreover, these methods usually rely on automatically 
annotated datasets, and these annotations are often imprecise and unreliable, limiting the achievable accuracy using 
this data as ground truth. For this reason, in this paper we propose an annotation refinement tool of human poses, by 
means of body joints, and a novel set of fine joint annotations for the Watch-n-Patch dataset, which has been collected 
with the proposed tool. Furthermore, we present a fully-convolutional architecture that performs the body pose 
estimation directly on depth maps. The extensive evaluation shows that the proposed architecture outperforms the 
competitors in different training scenarios and is able to run in real-time.
