### Abstract
Event cameras, neuromorphic devices that naturally respond to brightness changes, have multiple advantages with respect 
to traditional cameras. However, the difficulty of applying traditional computer vision algorithms on event data limits 
their usability. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the use of a deep learning-based architecture that combines an 
initial grayscale frame and a series of event data to estimate the following intensity frames. In particular, a 
fully-convolutional encoder-decoder network is employed and evaluated for the frame synthesis task on an automotive 
event-based dataset. Performance obtained with pixel-wise metrics confirms the quality of the images synthesized by 
the proposed architecture.
