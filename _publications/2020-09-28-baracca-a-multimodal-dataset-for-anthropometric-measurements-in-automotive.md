### Abstract
The recent spread of depth sensors has enabled new methods to automatically estimate anthropometric measurements, in 
place of manual procedures or expensive 3D scanners. Generally, the use of depth data is limited by the lack of 
depth-based public datasets containing accurate anthropometric annotations. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new 
dataset, called Baracca, specifically designed for the automotive context, including in-car and outside views. The 
dataset is multimodal: it has been acquired with synchronized depth, infrared, thermal and RGB cameras in order to deal 
with the requirements imposed by the automotive context. In addition, we propose several baselines to test the 
challenges of the presented dataset and provide considerations for future work.
