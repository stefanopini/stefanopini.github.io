### Abstract
Natural User Interfaces can be an effective way to reduce driverâ€™s inattention during the driving activity. To this 
end, in this paper we propose a new dataset, called Briareo, specifically collected for the hand gesture recognition 
task in the automotive context. The dataset is acquired from an innovative point of view, exploiting different kinds of 
cameras, i.e. RGB, infrared stereo, and depth, that provide various types of images and 3D hand joints. Moreover, the 
dataset contains a significant amount of hand gesture samples, performed by several subjects, allowing the use of deep 
learning-based approaches. Finally, a framework for hand gesture segmentation and classification is presented, 
exploiting a method introduced to assess the quality of the proposed dataset.
