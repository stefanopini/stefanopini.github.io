### Abstract
In this paper, an adversarial architecture for facial depth map estimation from monocular intensity images is 
presented. By following an image-to-image approach, we combine the advantages of supervised learning and adversarial 
training, proposing a conditional Generative Adversarial Network that effectively learns to translate intensity face 
images into the corresponding depth maps. Two public datasets, namely Biwi database and Pandora dataset, are 
exploited to demonstrate that the proposed model generates high-quality synthetic depth images, both in terms of 
visual appearance and informative content. Furthermore, we show that the model is capable of predicting distinctive 
facial details by testing the generated depth maps through a deep model trained on authentic depth maps for the face 
verification task.
