### Abstract
Automatic image cropping techniques are particularly important to improve the visual quality of cropped images and can 
be applied to a wide range of applications such as photo-editing, image compression, and thumbnail selection. In this 
paper, we propose a saliency-based image cropping method which produces significant cropped images by only relying on 
the corresponding saliency maps. Experiments on standard image cropping datasets demonstrate the benefit of the 
proposed solution with respect to other cropping methods. Moreover, we present an image selection method that can be 
effectively applied to automatically select the most representative pages of historical manuscripts thus improving 
the navigation of historical digital libraries.
