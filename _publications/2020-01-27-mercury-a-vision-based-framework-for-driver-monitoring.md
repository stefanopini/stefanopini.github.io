### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a complete framework, namely Mercury, that combines Computer Vision and Deep Learning 
algorithms to continuously monitor the driver during the driving activity. The proposed solution complies to the 
requirements imposed by the challenging automotive context: the light invariance, in order to have a system able to 
work regardless of the time of day and the weather conditions. Therefore, infrared-based images, i.e. depth maps (in 
which each pixel corresponds to the distance between the sensor and that point in the scene), have been exploited in 
conjunction with traditional intensity images. Second, the non-invasivity of the system is required, since driver's 
movements must not be impeded during the driving activity: in this context, the use of cameras and vision-based 
algorithms is one of the best solutions. Finally, real-time performance is needed since a monitoring system must 
immediately react as soon as a situation of potential danger is detected.
