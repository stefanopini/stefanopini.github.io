### Abstract
Transformer-based neural networks represent a successful self-attention mechanism that achieves state-of-the-art 
results in language understanding and sequence modeling. However, their application to visual data and, in particular, 
to the dynamic hand gesture recognition task has not yet been deeply investigated. In this paper, we propose a 
transformer-based architecture for the dynamic hand gesture recognition task. We show that the employment of a single 
active depth sensor, specifically the usage of depth maps and the surface normals estimated from them, achieves 
state-of-the-art results, overcoming all the methods available in the literature on two automotive datasets, namely 
NVidia Dynamic Hand Gesture and Briareo. Moreover, we test the method with other data types available with common 
RGB-D devices, such as infrared and color data. We also assess the performance in terms of inference time and number 
of parameters, showing that the proposed framework is suitable for an online in-car infotainment system.
