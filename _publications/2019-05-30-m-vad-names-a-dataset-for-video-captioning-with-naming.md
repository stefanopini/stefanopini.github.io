### Abstract
Current movie captioning architectures are not capable of mentioning characters with their proper name, replacing them 
with a generic "someone" tag. The lack of movie description datasets with characters' visual annotations surely plays a 
relevant role in this shortage. Recently, we proposed to extend the M-VAD dataset by introducing such information. In 
this paper, we present an improved version of the dataset, namely M-VAD Names, and its semi-automatic annotation 
procedure. The resulting dataset contains 63 k visual tracks and 34 k textual mentions, all associated with character 
identities. To showcase the features of the dataset and quantify the complexity of the naming task, we investigate 
multimodal architectures to replace the "someone" tags with proper character names in existing video captions. The 
evaluation is further extended by testing this application on videos outside of the M-VAD Names dataset.
