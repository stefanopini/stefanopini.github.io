### Abstract
Event cameras are biologically-inspired sensors that gather the temporal evolution of the scene. They capture 
pixel-wise brightness variations and output a corresponding stream of asynchronous events. Despite having multiple 
advantages with respect to traditional cameras, their use is partially prevented by the limited applicability of 
traditional data processing and vision algorithms. To this aim, we present a framework which exploits the output 
stream of event cameras to synthesize RGB frames, relying on an initial or a periodic set of color key-frames and the 
sequence of intermediate events. Differently from existing work, we propose a deep learning-based frame synthesis 
method, consisting of an adversarial architecture combined with a recurrent module. Qualitative results and 
quantitative per-pixel, perceptual, and semantic evaluation on four public datasets confirm the quality of the 
synthesized images.
